# MIDISheets

MIDISheets is a small desktop application which allows users to record a single line of music, and generate sheet music based on that.
MIDISheets generates sheet music in the view of the application, and also writes a MIDI file to your desktop, which can be opened in the user's favorite music editing software.
`git clone`, `npm install` and `npm start` to run the application. 

This application was developed over the course of two days during a hackathon as a part of my time at Fullstack Acacdemy of Code.
Currently, the application is very finnicky in respect to background noise, and there must also be a small space between notes in order to pick up multiple notes in a row.
I am working right now to be able to distinguish different notes in one phrase, without space.
I'm also working on a total overhaul of the application's interface and experience.
